# Mathematics for MachineLearning and DeepLearning

Learning through teaching and doubts is always my first way of learning. Without doubts how can you be so sure that you are learning at all.
Rather the Headings I am giving here , I will not actually point out all the Mathematics we are using in ML and DL but will Try to show you why these maths actually makes sense.

## List of Algorithms ( or Maths tricks )

- [x] weighted Averages
1. Exponantial encounter of weighted Averages
2. Why we are using weighted averages ? Its a beautiful mathematical tricks ( Nothing more !)
3. Are really weighted averages really important ? Think the life of ML engineers without it.
4. The New Era of weighted averages

- [X] Bias correction in Exponentially weighted averages
